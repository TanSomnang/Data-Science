The Ministry of Public Works and Transport is working to expedite the drafting of the law on wastewater and sewage.
The ministry is expecting that this draft law will help prevent the unauthorised drainage of wastewater and improve the sewage system in the country while further developing sewage infrastructure significantly.
On January 6, Kem Borey – undersecretary of state and deputy head of the ministry’s working group – chaired a meeting to discuss the draft law.
Borey set the agenda for the meeting, saying they would discuss Article 30 of the draft law in order to revise and define the wording more clearly and comprehensively so as to avoid misinterpretation during its implementation.
“We wanted to have a meeting to review the draft law for some time but had not been able to do so due to Covid-19. But early this year our team is going to continue the examination of the draft law,” he said.
